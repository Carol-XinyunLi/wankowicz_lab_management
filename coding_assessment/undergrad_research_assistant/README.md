The goal of this assessment is to see where you are at in terms of coding. There is no pass/fail for this. I ask that you complete the assessment without accessing AI assisted tools (although we encourage it in the lab!).
The main reason for this assessment is to give an idea of where your coding knowledge is so we can craft an appropriate project. Stop when you get to 2 hours and send it to me (wherever you get to)


The goal of this assessement is to determine the Root Mean Squared Fluctuation (RSMF) of every residue over [>50 PDB structures](./PDBs/). The PDB structures are all of the same protein with the same numbering of amino acids. They have also already been aligned. 



You goal is (without loading in biology or PDB specific packages!) to create a python script that can complete the following:

1) Read in PDB files
2) Loop through the PDB files based on chain and residue number
3) For every residue calculate the RMSF and record it in some way
4) Create a plot of the RMSF of every residue across the protein


Here are few resources about PDB files and RMSF:

[PDB Files](https://www.umass.edu/microbio/rasmol/pdb.htm#:~:text=PDB%20files%20are%20plain%20text,several%20other%20types%20if%20present.)

These structures are coming from the paper [Iterative computational design and crystallographic screening identifies potent inhibitors targeting the Nsp3 macrodomain of SARS-CoV-2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36598939/)
